# Dependencies

You may need to install the following:

```console
$ sudo apt install swipl
$ pip3 install pwntools
```

# Run the script an all the submissions

Be sure to put the extracted `assignment1` folder (download it from Slack) in the same directory as `main.sh`

```console
$ chmod 700 main.sh
$ ./main.sh
```

For better results, pipe the output into a file.

# Standalone run

To run the tester on a single submission:

```console
$ chmod 700 standalone.sh
$ ./standalone.sh <path_to_the_submission_code_folder>
```

For better results, pipe the output into a file.
